Health check specification
==========================

All apps that run in production are required to have an HTTP health check endpoint, even if they are event-driven.  This health check must comply with [the spec](#health-check-spec). The main function of these health checks is to enable the apps to signal to the platform whether or not they are functional.  The platform will then use this information to manage routing to the app and the lifecycle of the app.

A health check is comprised of two components:

1. [The checks](#checks): A specific test (can be external or internal) that is triggered on a fixed interval to ascertain the current health state.  A health check has many registered checks.
2. [The health check endpoint](#health-check-endpoint): The endpoint that returns information about the current health check state.

Checks
------

The purpose of a health check is so that a monitoring tool can quickly determine the current fitness of that app to perform its function.  This means that a health check can have many different checks, and indeed many different types of checks.  These checks can be against external dependencies or the internal functioning of the app.

Some examples of things that can be checked are:

* the status of the connections to the data stores and other third party dependencies
* the status of other apps the app depends on
* the status of the host on which the app is running
* the status of the application logic (e.g. Kafka message processing failures, request processing failures, concurrent request thresholds, etc.)

The following requirements must be met by health check implementations:

* The app must perform checks in order to determine its current status.
* The checks must all run all on a fixed interval that can be set per app
* The checks must have a failure threshold per check of the number of sequential failed checks before which the check is marked as a failure
* The checks must have a healthy threshold per check of the number of sequential healthy checks before which the check is marked as healthy
* Changes in check statuses (including the overall app status) must be logged out

### Check statuses

The status of the check can be one of three values:

Status     | Description
-----------|--------------
`OK`       | Everything is ok
`WARNING`  | Things are degraded, but at least partially functioning
`CRITICAL` | Failure, your app will now be unable to function

Health check endpoint
---------------------

The health check data is served via the health check endpoint.  This health check data comes in two forms.  The status code provides a quick way to get the overall status of the app, while the JSON body provides further information that might be useful in triaging any issues.

The following requirements must be met by health check implementations:

* All apps must have a health check endpoint
* The health check endpoint must be available as a `GET /healthcheck` endpoint
* The health check must return the [appropriate status code](#health-check-status-codes)
* The health check must return [status information as JSON](#health-check-body)

### Health check status codes

There are three standard status codes that a health check can return:

Status code | Description
------------|------------------------
`200`       | I'm fine
`429`       | I'm warming up or I'm degraded
`500`       | Kill me

The health check should return 429 until the first checks have been run.  After that, the codes returned should be based on the check status.  It is the responsibility of whatever is monitoring the health check to provide a grace period on startup.

If any check returns a `CRITICAL` status (see [check statuses below](#check-statuses) then the app should transition to a `429`.  After a timeout that can be set per app, the `429` will be downgraded `500`.  This delay in marking the app as `500` is to allow the issue a chance to resolve on its own before moving to a `500` which will result in the app being killed.

If any check returns a `WARNING` status (see [check statuses below](#check-statuses) then the app should transition to a `429`.  In this situation, the timeout does not apply and the app will continue to return a `429` until the status of the checks changes.

Any status code â‰¥ 400 && != 429 will be treated as a failure.

### Health check body

The JSON body of the health check should implement the following spec:

Field        | Type     | Description
-------------|----------|---------------
`status`     | `string` | The overall status of the health check using the values as the [check statuses](#check-statuses)
`version`    | `string` | The version information of the app (e.g. commit, semver version, go version, build time, etc) as a string.
`uptime`     | `ms`     | Milliseconds elapsed since the app started <sup>1</sup>
`start_time` | `ISO8601`<sup>2</sup> | The time the app started in UTC
`checks`     | [`[]Check`](#check)   | An array of the checks with details of their statuses

<sup>1</sup> The start time of the app is approximate as we use the time at which the health check library was instantiated.

<sup>2</sup> `ISO8601` UTC date time (`2006-01-02T15:04:05.999Z`)

#### Check

The following fields make up the details provided for each check in the array of checks within the JSON body.

Field          | Type     | Required | Description
---------------|----------|----------|--------------
`name`         | `string` | Yes      | Name of the check
`status`       | `string` | Yes      | The [status of the check](#check-statuses)
`status_code`  | `int`    | No       | The status code returned by the external service (only for use with external http checks)
`message`      | `string` | Yes      | Brief description of the status (i.e. `OK` or `received 500 from 'dp-dataset-api'`)
`last_checked` | `ISO8601`<sup>1</sup> | Yes | The last time the check was run
`last_success` | `ISO8601`<sup>1</sup> | Yes | The time of the last successful check
`last_failure` | `ISO8601`<sup>1</sup> | Yes | The time of the last failed check

<sup>1</sup> `ISO8601` UTC date time (`2006-01-02T15:04:05.999Z`)
